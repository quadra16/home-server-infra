# Home Server Infrastructure

This repository documents a production-like, Docker-based home server
used to run media services, AI-powered photo management, monitoring,
and gaming workloads with an emphasis on isolation, reliability, and
operational simplicity.

The system is intentionally kept on a single Docker Compose stack to
reduce operational complexity while still enforcing clear service
boundaries via networking, volumes, and resource control.
